# Compress

## Huffman Coding
The Huffman code is the typical classic among compression codes, as this is an algorithm for lossless data compression. The C# code has a simple structure and fulfills the very fast derivation of the Huffman code, as well as the decoding. It's worth taking a look.

## Exponential-Golomb-Codes
Exponential-Golomb-Codes (also known as Exp-Golomb-Coding) represent integers with bit patterns that become longer for larger numbers. One would think. The Exponential-Golomb-Code created here performs an analysis beforehand and adapts the length of the code to the frequency.
